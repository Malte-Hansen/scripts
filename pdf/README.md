# PDF Scripts

Scripts which use the [pypdf](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library.

### Further Ideas

- Text extraction (see [here](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extract-text.html))
- Diffs for PDF files (1 sentence per line), similar to `git diff`
- Search text in (multiple) PDFs
